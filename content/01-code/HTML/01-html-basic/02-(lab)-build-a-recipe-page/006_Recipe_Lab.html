                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups of industrial-strength cement mix</li>
                    <li>1 cup of sparkling quartz dust</li>
                    <li>
                        Half a liter of purified moon water (or tap water if
                        you're on a budget)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3 drops of essential oil (for ambiance only — do not
                        mix!)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 pair of safety goggles, preferably rhinestone-studded
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Put on your rhinestone-studded safety goggles. Safety is
                        fabulous.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a large, glitter-free mixing bowl, combine the cement
                        mix and quartz dust.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slowly pour in the purified moon water while stirring
                        gently (clockwise only — counter-clockwise ruins the
                        vibe).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep mixing until the texture is smoother than a luxury
                        skincare commercial.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let the cement rest for 5 minutes while you post a story
                        about it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour the mix into your chosen mold — hearts, stars, or
                        traditional blocks, your call.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let dry for at least 24 hours, ideally under the full
                        moon.
                    </li>
                </ol>
