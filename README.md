# freeCodeCamp FullStack - My Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with the freeCodeCamp FullStack course, including both course examples and my personal projects. It is structured into two main parts:

## Course Examples (lessons)

In this section, you will find examples from each lesson in the freeCodeCamp FullStack course. The examples are organized according to the course modules, with clear naming conventions to help you understand the topics covered.

## Personal Mini Projects (myLabs)

Here, I've included the mini projects I created as part of the course. These projects are my own creations and are designed to reflect the skills and concepts I've learned through the course. They are also organized to align with the themes taught in the curriculum.
